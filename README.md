#ReportsBundle

[![StyleCI](https://styleci.io/repos/75387636/shield?branch=master)](https://styleci.io/repos/75387636)

Whereas [QBJSParserBundle](https://github.com/fourlabsldn/QBJSParserBundle) provides you with a wrapper to parse,
and construct Report Builders, this bundle helps you create, view, edit, and delete your reports. Hence this bundle,
introduces the concept of a `FL\ReportsBundle\Model\Report` model class.

Furthermore, this bundle provides controllers in the namespace, `FL\ReportsBundle\Action`.

### Taking a step back 

This bundle has had its controllers trimmed for the moment. Please wait for further development.
